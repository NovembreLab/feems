Installation
############

We've found that the easiest way to get started is to setup a conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda create -n=feems_e python=3.8.3 
  conda activate feems_e

Some of the plotting utilities in the ``feems`` package require ``geos`` as a dependency which can be installed on mac with brew as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

  brew install geos

Unfortunately some of the dependencies for feems are not easily installed by pip so we recommend getting started using conda:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda install -c conda-forge suitesparse=5.7.2 scikit-sparse=0.4.4 cartopy=0.18.0 jupyter=1.0.0 jupyterlab=2.1.5 sphinx=3.1.2 sphinx_rtd_theme=0.5.0 nbsphinx=0.7.1 sphinx-autodoc-typehints

We added jupyter and jupyterlab to explore some example notebooks but these are not necessary for the feems package. Once the conda environment has been setup with these tricky dependencies we can install feems:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install git+https://github.com/jhmarcus/feems

You can also install feems locally by:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/jhmarcus/feems
  cd feems/
  pip install .
